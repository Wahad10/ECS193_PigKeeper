**Technology Survey**

**Team 16**

##### Frontend



* Android Studio/Kotlin
    * Pros
        * Android specific development features
        * Kotlin is similar to Java, which we are familiar with
        * Supports OpenCV (used for computer vision)
    * Cons
        * No iOS support
* React Native 
    * Pros
        * Cross platform, meaning we use a single codebase. 
        * Quick Testing Output Results
    * Cons
        * General purpose app development can cause lack of features

Conclusion: We will use Android Studio/Kotlin as we will be focusing on making a quality Android product, and this choice will provide us with the proper features to make it happen. 



##### Computer Vision 




* OpenCV (or another image processing library)
    * Pros
        * Can specify environment to handle images
        * More control with better feedback
        * Easy to learn
    * Cons
        * Not good for uncontrolled environments
        * May only work for dotted dice \

* Machine Learning
    * Pros
        * Extremely versatile
        * Can use existing images
    * Cons
        * Popular in python (we don't plan on using python)
        * Steep learning curve
        * Time consuming

Conclusion: As this decision hinges on future progress, we have yet to decide on which technology to use for Computer Vision. We can properly make a decision based on our results with the Alpha product.

##### Project Management



* Jira Cloud
    * Pros
        * Github integration
        * Sprint support
        * Backlog
    * Cons
        * Some customization restrictions (subtasks canâ€™t have subtasks)

Conclusion: We will be using Jira Cloud for project management as it provides the necessary framework to properly create, manage, and complete sprints to help us stay organized and on top of our tasks. It also supports GitHub integration.
