### **Philosophy**



* [DRY Principle](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dry)
    * Don’t repeat yourself. Reduce duplicate code/logic and instead use more referenceable code, which will make code easier to understand, more maintainable, and consistent.
* [Single Responsibility Principle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/single-responsibility-in-solid-design-principle/)
    * Classes/methods should only have one responsibility and therefore only one reason to change.
* Don’t adhere to any principle/philosophy so strictly that it leads to more issues than advantages.
* Find joy in the mud, strength in the herd, and wisdom in each oink.


# **Commitment**

We the undersigned are committed to complete ECS 193A in Winter, enroll and complete ECS 193B in Spring.
