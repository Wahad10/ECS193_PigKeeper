**Team 16 - PigKeeper**

**Development Plan**

**Meeting Times**

_Client:_ TBD

_TA: _TBD

_Team: _Tuesdays 3:00-3:30pm

**Expected Tasks/Features**

###### Quality of Life (QoL) Changes: 
This includes dealing with long player names (limiting character count), adding a “How to Play” screen, and possibly revamping Turn Order/Sit Out Screen (drag and drop perhaps). Being able to save custom rule presets.



* _Expected Completion Date:  Week 4 (4/26)_

###### Finalize User Interface Design: 
Improving user interface and style. This would include changes that make the app more fun to use (tactile feel, colors/stylization) as well as other miscellaneous UI considerations (properly ordering and coloring of scores in Pot Screen, settings screen)



* _Expected Completion Date:  Week 7 (5/17)_

###### Testing/Debugging/Documentation:
There are currently multiple bugs to resolve. We also need to keep our documentation updated as new features get added and as we polish the user interface.



* _Expected Completion Date:  Week 9 (Ongoing but final polish around 5/31)_

###### Dice Recognition (Stretch):
Using computer vision, we hope to be able to incorporate dice recognition into PigKeeper. This would work by using the phone’s camera to capture dice rolls and automatically register them into the game instead of having to input them by hand. Using dice recognition to input rolls would be an option for the player in the settings. 



* _Expected Completion Date:  Week 9 (5/31)_
